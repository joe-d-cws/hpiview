 v0.0.2 (still very incomplete!)
 ======

 Saruman here. I've taken a small peek at the .GAF files TA uses to store
 animations. This is how I figure it so far...

 First, the main header (GAF_HEADER)

  Name               Size           Offset
  ============================================
  IDversion          Longword       $00-
  entries            Longword       $04-
  unknown            Longword       $08-         (always 0?)

 the "unknown" entry is zero in all files I've inspected. Maybe reserved
 for future use? (seems odd not to make the header a multiple of sixteen,
 but...)

 After this small header (3*8 bytes) comes list of pointers (Longword
 sized ofcourse, I call them GAF_ENTRY_PTRs). There's one pointer for
 each 'entry', pointing to another structure which is stored at the end
 of the file.

 Let's look at that structure (GAF_ENTRY_STRUCTURE):

  Name               Size           Offset (GAF_ENTRY_PTR+)
  ============================================
  frames             Word           $00-
  unknown1           Word           $02-
  unknown2           Longword       $04-
  name               32 chars       $08-

 after this comes yet _another_ list... phew.. this is a list in the form of
 a structure:

  Name               Size           Offset (GAF_ENTRY_PTR+$28)
  ============================================
  PTRframetable      Longword       $00-
  unknown            Longword       $04-$07

 This is repeated 'frames' times. The "unknown" is probably a 'size/length' of
 some structure.

 Now, what's a the PTRframetable? This, I cannot say for sure. I would think
 that this contains a width and height word and a list of pointers to the
 graphics data (or to a structure pointing to graphics data)... But then, I've
 been known to be wrong a times. :-)

 I sure hope someone at cavedog is getting a great laught out of this :-)
 (you you are, feel free to laugh at me in e-mail. I would be an great honor)

******************************
Joe D here!  Here's some stuff about PTRframetable.

  Name               Size           Offset
  ============================================
  width              word           $00
  height             word           $02
  Unknown            word           $04
  Unknown            word           $06
  Unknown            long           $08
  Unknown            long           $0C
  PTRframedata       long           $10
  Unknown            long           $14

  Some of those unknown word pairs may really be longs, and some of those 
  unknown longs may be word pairs.

  PTRframedata points to stuff that looks to be pixel data.

  For each pixel line ("height" the PTRframetable), there is a word giving the
  amount of data, followed by that many bytes of data.

  if byte >= 0x30
    it's a pixel. plot it.
  else if (byte & 1) <> 0
    skipcount = byte >> 1
    skip over skipcount pixels
  else if (byte & 0x3) = 2
    repeatcount = (byte >> 2) + 1
    repeat next byte repeatcount times
  else
    ????  no idea.  ignore it for now.
  end if
