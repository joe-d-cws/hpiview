IT's easy 

for example use ARMFLAKER_GADGET.GAF

at adress $10 it's the start of first picture

you see in HEX  

04 00 00 5B FA FF 41 00 E0 5B 94 ....

04 is number of byte to read for decode 1 horizontal line of 40 bytes
00 is a separator

the first line to decode is 00 5B FA FF

00 is a MASK 
 if mask AND $02 = 02 thats a counter 

else it's adress for the next counter

 the adress is given by MASK with ADRESS = (MASK DIV 4) + 1 
 in this example ADRESS = 1  it's relatif adress;

then 5B is single value

at ADRESS = 1 there's FA

FA AND 02 = 02 then COUNTER = (FA + 2) DIV 4 = 3F

THEN YOU COPY FF  for 3F time

and you have a complete line 

Note: after a value to COPY you have a byte MASK (MASK or COUNTER) if the
line is not completed
